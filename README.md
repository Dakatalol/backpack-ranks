---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Test the Rank 1000 Tracker

```bash
python n8n_tracker.py
```

This tracks rank 1000's volume (the minimum to stay in top 1000). Run it 2-3 times over a few days to build historical baseline.

**Sample output:**
```json
{
  "current": {
    "rank_1000_volume": 2272851.78,
    "user_at_rank_1000": "circuitously-wise-char"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "difficulty_score": 90.91,
    "volume_change_percent": -9.09,
    "recommendation": "✅ GOOD TIME TO FARM"
  }
}
```

### 3. Optional: Full CLI for Detailed Analysis

If you want detailed statistics beyond rank 1000:

```bash
python main.py collect  # Collect all 1000 entries
python main.py analyze  # Detailed statistical analysis
```

## What This Tool Does

Tracks rank 1000's volume to tell you if it's a good time to farm:

- ⚡ **Fast**: Tracks only rank 1000 volume
- 🎯 **Focused**: Directly tells you the minimum volume needed for top 1000
- 📊 **Clean Output**: JSON output perfect for n8n
- 💾 **Efficient**: Minimal database storage

**What it tracks:**
- Current rank 1000 volume
- Historical average of rank 1000 volume
- Difficulty score based on rank 1000 comparison
- Recommendation: Is it a good time to farm?

**Difficulty Score:**
- `< 80` = 🎯 EXCELLENT TIME (20%+ easier than average)
- `80-95` = ✅ GOOD TIME (easier than average)
- `95-105` = ➖ AVERAGE CONDITIONS
- `105-120` = ⚠️ HARDER THAN USUAL

```bash
npm install n8n -g
```

Verify installation:
```bash
n8n --version
```

---

#### Step 2: Create Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Choose a name (e.g., "Backpack Volume Tracker")
4. Choose a username ending in 'bot' (e.g., "backpack_volume_bot")
5. **Save the bot token** - you'll need this later

Example token: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`

---

#### Step 3: Get Your Chat ID

1. Search for **@userinfobot** in Telegram
2. Start a chat with it
3. It will reply with your user information
4. **Save your Chat ID** (the number shown as "Id")

Example: `987654321`

---

#### Step 4: Start n8n

```bash
n8n start
```

n8n will open at `http://localhost:5678`

---

#### Step 5: Import Workflow

1. In n8n, click **"Workflows"** → **"Import from File"**
2. Select `n8n_workflow.json` from this project
3. The workflow will be imported with all nodes

---

#### Step 6: Set Project Path

1. Click on the **"Execute Python Script"** node
2. Set the working directory to your project path
3. The command should already be: `python n8n_tracker.py`
4. Click **"Save"**

**To find your project path:**
- **Windows**: Open project folder in Explorer, copy path from address bar
- **Linux/Mac**: Run `pwd` in the project directory

---

#### Step 7: Configure Telegram Credentials

1. Click on any **"Send to Telegram"** node
2. Under **"Credentials"**, click **"Create New"**
3. Enter:
   - **Credential Name**: `Backpack Telegram Bot`
   - **Access Token**: Your bot token from @BotFather
4. Click **"Save"**

---

#### Step 8: Set Your Chat ID

Update the chat ID in the Telegram nodes:

1. Click on **"Send Telegram Alert"** node
2. Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` with your actual chat ID (the number from @userinfobot)
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Do the same for **"Send Error Alert"** node

---

#### Step 9: Start Your Bot

**Important:** Before testing, you must start a conversation with your bot:

1. Open Telegram
2. Search for your bot (the username you created)
3. Click on it to open the chat
4. Send `/start` (or click the "Start" button)

---

#### Step 10: Test the Workflow

1. In n8n, click **"Execute Workflow"** button (top right)
2. Wait 5-10 seconds
3. Check your Telegram for a message! 📱

**Note:** You'll only get a message if conditions are favorable (difficulty score < 95). To test regardless of conditions, temporarily change the IF node condition or run `python n8n_tracker.py` directly to see the output.

---

#### Step 11: Activate Automation

1. Toggle the switch at the top right to **"Active"**
2. Keep n8n running
3. You'll now receive reports automatically at 8 AM and 8 PM!

---

### Running n8n Continuously

To keep n8n running so it can send scheduled reports:

**Option 1: Keep terminal open**
```bash
n8n start
```
Keep this terminal window open.

**Option 2: Run in background (Linux/Mac)**
```bash
nohup n8n start &
```

**Option 3: Windows Task Scheduler**
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Name: `n8n Backpack Tracker`
4. Trigger: **"When I log on"**
5. Action: **"Start a program"**
   - Program: `cmd.exe`
   - Arguments: `/c n8n start`

---

### What You'll Receive

You'll only get alerts when it's a good time to farm (difficulty score < 95):

```
✅ Backpack Volume Alert

GOOD TIME TO FARM - Rank 1000 volume is below average

📊 Current Rank 1000: $2.27M
👤 User: circuitously-wise-char
📈 Difficulty Score: 90.91/100
📉 Change: -9.09%

You need more than $2.27M in trading volume to be in the top 1000.
```

---

### Difficulty Score Guide

The difficulty score shows how hard it is to farm compared to historical average:

- 🎯 **< 80**: EXCELLENT TIME - 20%+ easier than average
- ✅ **80-95**: GOOD TIME - Easier than average  
- ➖ **95-105**: AVERAGE CONDITIONS - Normal competition
- ⚠️ **105-120**: HARDER THAN USUAL - Above average competition
- 🔴 **> 120**: VERY HARD - 20%+ harder than average

**Lower score = less competition = better time to farm**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Telegram: "Chat not found"

**Solution:** Send `/start` to your bot in Telegram first, then test again.

### Telegram: No message received

**Check:**
1. Bot token is correct in n8n credentials
2. Chat ID is correct (should be just the number in the Telegram node)
3. You've sent `/start` to your bot
4. Workflow is "Active" in n8n
5. n8n is running

You'll only get alerts when difficulty score < 95. To test, either:
- Wait until conditions are favorable
- Temporarily change the IF node condition to always pass
- Run `python n8n_tracker.py` directly to see current score

### Python: "Module not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### n8n: Workflow triggered but both paths firing

**Cause:** Missing IF node to route based on success/failure.

**Solution:** The workflow already has proper IF nodes:
1. First IF: Check if status === "success"
2. Second IF: Check if difficulty_score < 95

Make sure both IF nodes are configured correctly and connected properly.

### Schedule not triggering

**Check:**
1. Workflow is **Active** (green toggle)
2. n8n is running
3. Computer is on at scheduled times
4. Check n8n "Executions" tab for history

## Understanding the Metrics

### Difficulty Score
- Based on total and average volume compared to historical baseline
- Lower score = easier to farm (less competition)
- Higher score = harder to farm (more competition)

### Rank Thresholds
- Shows exact volume needed to achieve specific ranks
- Use this to set realistic farming goals
- Updated twice daily with current data

### Volume Change %
- Positive % = higher than average (harder to farm)
- Negative % = lower than average (easier to farm)
